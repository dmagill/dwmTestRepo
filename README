This is a top-level android project directory, containing files and subdirs used by various build tools.

This dir can be created by the script 'BuildAppTree'

Projects may be built using my custom bash scripts, or by scripts in combination with the 'buck' or 'ant'
build tools.

Files/dirs used by *all* build tools:
AndroidManifest.xml
libs
res
src

Files/dirs used by 'ant':
ant.properties
build.xml
local.properties
project.properties
gen/
bin/

Files/dirs used by 'buck':
BUCK
buck-out

To build with ant ==> ant release
this will create following under gen:
./gen/<packagePath>/R.java
./gen/<packagePath>/BuildConfig.java
and many files and subdirs under bin

To remove dirs/files created by ant ==> ant clean
this will delete bin/ and gen/ dirs
